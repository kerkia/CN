"""The legibility check of a town sprint map (ISSprOM 2019-2), after OCAD's (since OCAD 2018): what the standard asks that the
generator may break, counted rule by rule with the first places in Lambert 93, and fixed where a fix is safe.

  py legibility.py <race> [--fix] [--in FILE] [--out FILE]     DATA/<race>/map_objects.json, the report DATA/<race>/src/legibility.json

town_map.py runs it on its objects before writing them (`check(doc, fix=True)`), so every town map — Pixel's races and
Cartographier's « Plan de ville (sprint) » — comes out checked. The rules (symbols, the 0.4 mm gap…) are
site/assets/js/mapper/sets/legibility.json, which Cartographier's checks (mapper/checks.js) read too; the minimum sizes per symbol
are minimums.json's (docs/mapper/sets.mjs, from the specification).

The rules, and what is fixed (with fix: two passes — a fix can leave a scrap the second takes —, then a plain check, so that
the report says what is really left; about 3.5 min on Gif's 1.4 km²):
- gap: two impassable features (buildings, uncrossable walls and fences, 520 olive, 411, water, 709) less than 0.4 mm apart
  (1.6 m at 1:4000; under 0.02 mm they touch: OCAD's grid is 0.01 mm) — the specification: closed or widened. Closed: a wall's or
  fence's end drawn on to what lies straight ahead of it (one beside it is reported: drawn sideways it made zigzags of short
  parallel pieces), the gap between areas filled with the area's symbol (two buildings: one building; olive on either side:
  olive) — long gaps by a closing, two corners near each other by the hull of their near parts; a gap a path, stairway or passage
  runs through is left for the mapper to widen (`gap_way`); the wedge where two features meet at an angle is a dead end, not a
  gap; a notch or a hole narrower than 0.4 mm in one feature is filled (`notch`); a bridge's sides, two short 515 lines along a
  deck (`decks`, else found by their shape: `bridge_sides`), are no gap;
- width / sliver: an area's part narrower than its symbol's minimum width (minimums.json, else 0.3 mm), and the white strips left
  between areas: a runnable area's strip goes to the neighbour sharing most of its edge, an impassable one (olive, 411, water) is
  widened to its minimum; a building's narrow part is reported only;
- area: an area under its symbol's minimum area: given to its neighbour (a building: reported);
- length: a line under its symbol's minimum length (reported);
- contour_end: a contour that ends in the open, not at a stairway or the map's edge (reported: the mapper's « not allowed »; a
  contour runs through the buildings and across the streets, and is cut only where it crosses a stairway — ISSprOM);
- overlap: a line (path, wall, fence, stream, edge) or a point (tree, monument) inside a building — cut out or dropped —, two
  point symbols drawn over each other (the smaller tree dropped), the LiDAR's vegetation over an area with a vector source
  (cut), any other two ground areas over each other (reported);
- bridge: 512.1 anywhere but at a passage's mouth (reported);
- stairs: a stairway not standing on paving: the paving drawn under it at its width;
- path_paved: a path (505, 506, a paved footway 501.6-501.9) drawn on paving: cut there.
Not yet redrawn after a fix: the paved area's edge (501.1) and the 995 boundaries keep their place where an area moved."""
