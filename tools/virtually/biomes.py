FONTAINEBLEAU (owner, 2026-11-13, Trois Pignons: « photos, like for Sprint, to much improve the scene textures »): the colours
read on freely licensed photographs of the Trois Pignons on Wikimedia Commons (CC BY-SA / CC BY / CC0; only their colours are
used, nothing of them is kept or published — the medians of the forest floor under the pines, the white sand of the paths and
the open sand, the grey sandstone boulders, the Scots pines' bark; the bracken in autumn's browns), a little darker than the sunlit photos (the
game lights them).
