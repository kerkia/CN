      <h2>A race's score</h2>
      <p>Each race gives a score to every ranked runner. The score depends on the runner's time and on the difficulty of the course. The difficulty
        is measured on the runners present, from their CN: this is the <b>course value</b>.</p>
      <p>For each runner who has a CN, their CN is multiplied by their time: a runner with a CN of 6,000 who runs 50 minutes gives 300,000. The course
        value is the mean of these products for the fastest two thirds of the runners who have a CN. A runner's score is the course value
        divided by their time.</p>
      <div class="mx-eq">course value = mean of (CN × time) of the fastest two thirds
        <small>score = course value ÷ runner's time</small></div>
      <p>A runner who runs as their CN predicts gets a score close to their CN. If they run 10% faster, their score is 11% higher;
        if they run 10% slower, their score is 9% lower.</p>
      <h3>Example: a course with six runners</h3>
      ${r6Table("CN", [["In the value?", (i) => (i < r6.keep ? "yes" : "no")], ["Official score", (i, tm) => n0(r6.off / tm)]])}
      <p>Two thirds of six runners is four runners: A, B, C and D. The course value is the mean of their four products, that is
        ${n0(r6.off)}. A's score is ${n0(r6.off)} ÷ 50 = ${n0(r6.off / 50)}. E and F, the slowest, do not count in the value, but they get
        a score like the others.</p>
      <ul class="mx-list">
        <li><span>The CN used is the official CN published 15 days before the race (the “CN D-15”).</span></li>
        <li><span>When the course has only three runners with a CN, all three count in the value.</span></li>

        what the runner is usually worth. It is not a ranking: it is a step in the calculation, made of the races the runner has already run. The
        CN Top, on the other hand, keeps only the best races: it is what ranks the runners. As in the CN Top, races run in a junior class count less

        ${shareName(own(pf, "VTT", "sample_fraction") ?? 2 / 3)} in MTB and ski. It is FFCO's rule, which takes the fastest two thirds,
        with the share tuned for each discipline.</p>
      <div class="mx-eq">course value = mean of (usual level × time) of the fastest

      <p>The slowest runners on a course are those who made mistakes, and those who ran at their level. Counting them tells how tricky the
        course was; leaving them out tells how hard the course was when run without mistakes. The right share is not the same everywhere: in forest, where
        runners get lost in one race in twelve, almost the whole field is informative; in sprint, where mistakes are half as common, the slowest blur the
        measurement. Each share was chosen because it best predicts the results in its discipline

      <p>Here we assume that each runner's usual level equals their CN, and we leave the rescaling aside. F got lost: 90 minutes
        for a runner of level 5,000, while C, of the same level, took 62 minutes. The official rule measures the course on the four
        fastest, A to D: the value is ${n0(r6.off)}. In sprint, the Top method does the same. In forest, it takes ${fmt(r6.keepFor)} runners out of six
        (90% of six, rounded up), F included: the value becomes ${n0(r6.topFor)}, and A, who ran without a mistake, scores ${n0(r6.topFor / 50)} instead
        of ${n0(r6.off / 50)}. This course cost one runner in six dearly; the runner who ran it without a mistake is rewarded for it. On a real course of
        several dozen runners, a single mistake weighs much less, and the rescaling brings the general level back to ${fmt(pf.anchor_target)}.</p>

      <h2>${fmt(p6.top_n)} places for the best races</h2>
      <p>The Top scores of the last 12 months are sorted from best to worst, and only the best ${pctOf(p6.eligible_fraction)} are considered. Then
        ${fmt(p6.top_n)} places are filled, starting with the best score. Each race takes as many places as its weight: ${fmtW(pf.weights.cdf)} places

        any other race, selection races and regional championships included. The last race kept takes only the places that are left.</p>
      <p>The CN Top is the <b>weighted mean</b> of the scores kept: each score counts as many times as it has places. Take a French
        championship at 6,800, which takes 2 places, and four other races at 6,500, 6,400, 6,200 and 6,000, which take one place each. The CN Top is

        <li><span><b>Juniors' races count less and less as they age.</b> A race run in a junior class (M and W up to 20) takes its places like the
          others, but counts in the mean for 1 − its age ÷ 12 months (÷ two years in MTB, three in ski): in full on the race's day, half six months
          later, hardly at all at the end of the window. A junior improves fast: their races of ten months ago describe a slower runner. Adults' races
          keep their weight. A junior's CN Top can therefore move between two races.</span></li>
        <li><span>At least ${fmt(pf.min_scores)} races in the last 12 months are needed to be ranked. When fewer than ${fmt(p6.top_n)} places

        <li><span>Once the ${fmt(p6.top_n)} places are filled, one more race cannot lower an adult's CN Top: either it takes the place of a weaker
          race, or it stays out. This usually takes 10 races in 12 months, fewer with championships or national races.
          Until the places are filled, the CN Top is an ordinary mean, and a race worse than the others lowers it. For a junior, a recent race weighs
          more than the older ones it replaces: worse than them, it can lower their CN Top.</span></li>

          <p class="mx-lead">A good CN should foretell the results. For each runner, we take the CN they had <b>15 days before</b> the race: that
            CN knows nothing about the race. Then we look, course by course, at whether these CNs foretold the finishing order and the time differences. All

          <h2>The share of duels called right</h2>
          <p>On a course, each pair of runners forms a <b>duel</b>: there are 45 duels among 10 runners, and 11,175 among 150 runners. The CN calls
            a duel right when the runner with the higher CN finishes ahead of the other. When the two CNs are equal, the duel counts as half.</p>
          <p>A CN drawn at random would call half the duels right, that is 50%. No CN can call them all, because form on the day and mistakes
            decide part of the results.</p>
          <div class="mx-eq">share of duels called right = duels called right ÷ number of duels
            <small>calculated for each course, then averaged over all courses, each weighted by its number of runners</small></div>
          <p><b>Why each course is weighted by its number of runners.</b> Each runner faces every other runner on their course. The share of their
            duels called right says whether the CN placed them well among them. Averaging this share over all the runners of the season gives
            exactly the mean of the courses weighted by their number of runners: each result counts once. Counting each duel once would give
            too much weight to large courses, since a course of 150 runners would weigh as much as 250 courses of 10 runners. Counting each course
            once would give too much to small ones, since a course of 5 runners would weigh as much as a French championship course.</p>
          <p><b>The link with Kendall's τ.</b> Statisticians measure the agreement between two rankings with “Kendall's τ”: the share of duels
            called right minus the share of duels called wrong. With 80% of duels called right, and so 20% called wrong, τ is 0.80 − 0.20 = 0.60.
            It is the same measure on another scale: τ is 0 for a CN drawn at random and 1 for a perfect order. This document gives the share of
            duels, which is easier to grasp.</p>

          <p>The finishing order does not tell the whole story: finishing 10 seconds or 10 minutes behind another runner is not the same thing. Now a CN reads like
            a speed: a runner whose CN is 10% higher should run about 10% faster. On each course, we therefore compare each

          <p>The races of a season are only a sample of all possible races. With other races, the difference between two methods would have been
            slightly different. To find out by how much, we redo the calculation ${ev ? fmt(ev.boot) : "2,000"} times on seasons drawn at random. Each draw
            takes as many competitions as the real season, chosen at random from among them: some come out twice, others not at all.</p>

            <li><span><b>The 95% interval</b>, written in square brackets after each difference, runs from the smallest to the largest difference obtained in 95% of these
              draws. For example, “+0.40 [+0.35, +0.44]” means that the measured difference is 0.40 points, and that 95% of the draws give between 0.35 and
              0.44 points.</span></li>
            <li><span><b>A difference is called significant when its interval does not contain 0.</b> Almost all draws then give a difference of the same
              sign: the luck of the races is not enough to explain it. When the interval contains 0, for example [−0.02, +0.01], we cannot say
              which of the two methods is better.</span></li>
            <li><span><b>Whole competitions are drawn, not duels.</b> Runners in the same race share the terrain, the map and the weather:
              their duels are not independent. Drawing them one by one would give intervals that are too narrow, and so too optimistic.</span></li>

            veterans or juniors, would have its CNs pulled up, its courses would look harder, and its CNs would rise further. In the
            first trials, M/W21 runners were underrated in this way by about 13%.</p>

          <p class="mx-kicker">The geometric variant</p>
          <h2>An empirical method, studied for its performance</h2>
          <p>The <b>geometric Top</b> is another way of calculating the Top score, studied from 7 to 16 October 2026 and published on the site from 13 to 16
            October. It keeps everything else in the Top method: the six places, the race weights, the rescaling. It changes two calculations.</p>
          <ul class="mx-list">
            <li><span><b>The course value, as a geometric mean.</b> Instead of adding up the products usual level × time and then dividing by
              their number, you multiply them together and take the root: the square root for two products, the sixth root for six. Take two
              runners of the same level, on a course where that level usually takes 60 minutes: one runs it in 30 minutes, the other in 120. The ordinary
              mean of their times is (30 + 120) ÷ 2 = 75 minutes; their geometric mean is √(30 × 120) = 60 minutes. The runner twice
              too slow and the runner twice too fast cancel out: a badly lost runner counts, but weighs no more than a very fast one. On
              top of that comes a setting for the weight of the slowest runners, specific to each discipline: the whole field in forest, almost only the fastest
              two thirds in sprint, something in between in MTB and ski.</span></li>
            <li><span><b>The usual level, as a cubic mean.</b> Each score is cubed, the mean of these cubes is taken, and then its
              cube root. For three scores of 6,000, 5,000 and 4,000, the ordinary mean is 5,000 and the cubic mean 5,130: it leans towards the
              good races, without leaving out the others.</span></li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>A method derived from the data.</b> These choices were not set in advance. Only the geometric mean has a simple reason: times
            are compared in proportion. The rest was found in the results: the power of the mean, the share of the field and each
            discipline's setting were recalculated over fifteen seasons, several dozen variants in all, and each time kept because they predicted
            the duels better. The setting for the weight of the slowest runners, for example, is 0 in forest and 400 in sprint without anyone being able to say why: that is
            what the results pointed to. That was its appeal, since it was studied for its performance, and its limit: a
            rule that can neither be justified simply nor redone by hand.</p>
          <p>The first measurements, on 7 October, had started from another idea, making a slow time cost more by raising the time to a power; it
            amounted exactly to changing these two means.</p>

          <p>Over fifteen seasons, the two methods are level in forest, the geometric variant gains about 0.15 points in sprint, and the method
            retained a tenth of a point in MTB. These differences can be measured, but no runner would notice them: they amount to one or two duels in a thousand. Given this, the method
            retained is the one everyone can redo by hand, with ordinary means and FFCO's rule for the course, plus the share of the field.
            The geometric variant is still calculated for comparison, under the name “geometric Top”, for the accounts that analyse the methods.</p>
          <p>What it taught still holds: it is the course's measure, and first of all the share of the field it looks at, that made the difference between
            the methods. In forest, the whole field or 90% gain nearly half a point over the two thirds, whatever the mean; the geometric mean
            added nothing more. In sprint, it added 0.15 points.</p>

          <h2>A factor extended at the pace of the rise in level</h2>
          <p>A runner's CN is made of their best races: it is a little above their ordinary races. The following courses are measured with
            these slightly high levels, their scores come out a little higher, and so do the CNs that follow from them: before rescaling, the general level rises by
            a few tenths of a percent per month. Rescaling brings it back to ${fmt(pf.anchor_target)}. But a day's factor is calculated on the level
            measured before that day, and each CN itself sums up a year of races: in all, it corrected the level as it was 18 to 20 months earlier, and the
            published level exceeded the target by 7% in forest.</p>
          <p>The correction retained extends the 13-month mean at the average pace of the rise over the last ten years. This pace changes very little from one month
            to the next, the factor stays smooth, and since 2018 the published level has stayed on average within 2% of ${fmt(pf.anchor_target)} in forest and MTB, within 3% in sprint (up to 6 to 9%
            after the Covid seasons, whose few races upset the pace of the rise). A
            factor that moves in jolts puts the scores of two neighbouring months at different levels: a straight line recalculated each month cost 0.06 points.
            ${L?.recalage_gain ? html`Applied to the method retained, the correction gains ${pts(L.recalage_gain.For)} of duels in forest and changes nothing

            <li><span><b>Usual level</b>: for each runner, 15 days before the race, the weighted mean of their best ${pctOf(pf.eligible_fraction)} of
              Top scores from the last 12 months, each according to its weight, with no limit on places (in MTB and ski: 70% of the scores, over two and three years),
              a race run in a junior class counting for 1 − its age ÷ the window. It is not a ranking, but a step in calculating the course value.</span></li>
            <li><span><b>Course value</b>: the mean of the products usual level × time of the fastest runners who have a level:
              ${shareName(own(pf, "For", "sample_fraction") ?? 2 / 3)} in forest, ${shareName(own(pf, "Spr", "sample_fraction") ?? 2 / 3)} in sprint,

              in each discipline at ${fmt(pf.anchor_target)}. It is calculated on the level measured two months earlier, averaged over 13 months, extended by 10 months at the pace of the rise

          <p class="mx-kicker">Why this one</p>
          <h2>The simplest of those that predict best</h2>
          <p>All the variants tried in October 2026 are within a few tenths of a point of one another in duels called right, and the best within a few
            hundredths. At that level, a gain no longer shows in a ranking, but a complicated rule shows in every explanation. The method retained
            therefore keeps FFCO's score and ordinary means, and changes only what really matters: the best races kept over six places,
            a share of the field set per discipline to measure the courses, and continuous rescaling. It gains more than two points of duels over the official
            CN in forest as in sprint. Since juniors' races count less and less as they age, it does better in forest than the geometric variant
            that preceded it, an empirical method tuned on the data for its performance, and as well in sprint.</p>

          <h2>Setting courses in the browser</h2>
          <p class="mx-lead">“Organising › Course setting” is for preparing the courses of a race or a training session, from the blank map to the printed maps:
            placing the controls, building the courses, filling in the descriptions, checking, printing, preparing the files for timing. Nothing to install:
            everything happens in the browser, and the event is saved on the site.</p>
          <p>It follows the course-setting rules and the file format of <a href="https://purple-pen.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Purple Pen</a>,
            Peter Golde's free course-setting software, which many clubs know: an event can go from one to the other, both ways. It also has its
            own file, the O'CN file (.ocnt), which keeps the whole event and its map in a single file. You don't need to know Purple Pen to
            use it: this guide explains everything.</p>
          <div class="mx-callout"><b>Beta version.</b> The course-setting tool has only just been built and has had little testing so far: try it, and tell us what goes
            wrong through the “Contact us” page (the menu under your name). It is not yet advised for preparing a real competition; it is very well suited to training
            maps.</div>
          <h3>The steps</h3>
          <div class="mx-steps" style="--c:#a7179b">
            <div class="mx-step"><b>Create the event</b>The “Course setting” page opens on three choices; “New event”: a competition of your club or a training session, and its map.</div>
            <div class="mx-step"><b>Place the controls</b>With the Control tool, on the “All controls” tab or directly in a course.</div>
            <div class="mx-step"><b>Build the courses</b>One tab per course: start, controls in order, finish.</div>
            <div class="mx-step"><b>Fill in the descriptions</b>In the left-hand pane, box by box, symbols or text.</div>
            <div class="mx-step"><b>Check</b>Lengths, climb, controls too close together, forgotten descriptions: the Check tab.</div>
            <div class="mx-step"><b>Print and export</b>The PDFs of the maps and descriptions, the files for timing.</div>
          </div>
          <h3>The three choices</h3>
          <p>The “Course setting” page opens the course-setting screen straight away, empty, and over it three choices:</p>
          <ul class="mx-list">
            <li><b>New event</b>: set the courses of a competition of your club or of a training session. You need the map.</li>
            <li><b>Import event</b>: take up an event prepared elsewhere, on another account, in another club or in Purple Pen. You need an
              O'CN file (.ocnt), which already holds the map, or a Purple Pen file (.ppen) and its map file.</li>
            <li><b>Open event</b>: one of those you created or whose team includes you, from the list.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Files dropped on this screen choose for you: a map alone starts a new event, a .ocnt or a .ppen an import. The
            “Events” button, top left, and the File page (New, Open, Import) bring these three choices back at any time; Esc closes them. A link that names an event opens it
            directly.</p>
          <h3>Creating an event</h3>
          <p>“New event” asks for:</p>
          <ul class="mx-list">
            <li><b>A competition or a training session.</b> A competition is chosen from the list of upcoming races and those of the last 60 days organised by your
              club (the club of your latest race): only its members can create it. A training session can be created by anyone, with a title and a date.</li>
            <li><b>The map</b>, dropped or chosen: the OCAD or Mapper file, a PDF or an image (chapter “The map”).</li>
            <li><b>The map's scale</b> (read from the OCAD or Mapper file) and its <b>standard</b>: forest (ISOM 2017) or sprint (ISSprOM 2019), which sets the size
              of the circles and numbers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>“Import event” asks for the same details (competition or training session) and the file: an O'CN file (.ocnt) reopens just as it was
            saved, with its map; a Purple Pen file (.ppen) with its map. If the map given is not the file's own (a PDF instead of the OCAD
            map, for example), you then align the controls in two clicks.</p>
          <div class="mx-grid">
            <div class="mx-box" style="--c:var(--s1)"><h3>Who sees it</h3><p>Its team only: its creator and the licence holders they add, as course setter,
              controller or viewer. Not the site's administrators: the courses stay secret until the race.</p></div>
            <div class="mx-box" style="--c:var(--s3)"><h3>Saved automatically</h3><p>A few seconds after each change; a version is kept every
              30 minutes of work, and you can keep one under a name (${W("version-save")}).</p></div>
            <div class="mx-box" style="--c:var(--s5)"><h3>Encrypted if you wish</h3><p>With a team passphrase (${W("encryption")}), the server
              keeps only unreadable data. A lost passphrase cannot be recovered: first export an O'CN file (${W("export-ocn")}), which
              is not encrypted.</p></div>

          <h2>The map</h2>
          <h3>Which file to give</h3>
          <div class="mx-grid">
            <div class="mx-box" style="--c:var(--s1)"><h3>OCAD or Mapper</h3><p>The best choice: the .ocd file (OCAD 6 to 12 and 2018) or .omap / .xmap
              (OpenOrienteering Mapper). The map is drawn symbol by symbol: sharp at every zoom, printed as vectors, at the right size with no
              adjustment; its scale, its georeferencing and its purple are taken over.</p></div>
            <div class="mx-box" style="--c:var(--s3)"><h3>PDF</h3><p>Exported from OCAD or Mapper, it stays sharp in print: it goes as it is into the courses'
              PDFs. Its dimensions are those of the page.</p></div>
            <div class="mx-box" style="--c:var(--s5)"><h3>Image</h3><p>JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, WebP or TIFF, even a scan or a photo taken really flat. Its
              distances come from its <b>resolution</b>: at 300 dots per inch, 1 mm of map is 11.8 dots.</p></div>
          </div>
          <p>An image's resolution is read from the file when the file gives it; otherwise you are asked for it. To check it, measure a known distance
            (${W("rep-legs")}); ${W("event-props")} corrects it. An OCAD map can call on other files as a background
            (“templates”, an aerial photo): they are not drawn.</p>
          <p>The slider under the zoom buttons (or Map › View › Intensity) fades the map, to see the course better. ${W("map-change")} puts in another one (a corrected version,
            a better scan, the OCAD file instead of an image): the controls keep their place on the sheet, their coordinates (a new version of the same
            OCAD file), their place on the ground (two georeferenced maps), or are aligned afterwards in two clicks.</p>
          <h3>The course's purple</h3>
          <p>The Map › Purple group sets how the course sits on the map; each way is shown there in miniature:</p>
          <ul class="mx-list">
            <li><b>On top</b>: the purple covers the map.</li>
            <li><b>Blended</b>: the map's black stays visible through the purple, as when it is overprinted.</li>
            <li><b>In layers</b> (OCAD or Mapper map): the circles, the lines and the out-of-bounds areas go under the map's colours above a chosen
              colour, usually under the black of the paths and rocks; the numbers stay on top.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>On an OCAD or Mapper map, the purple is by default the map's own; you can give another one in CMYK (Map › Purple › Appearance). The “overprint effects” (Map › Purple › Overprint) show
            the colours the map marks as “overprint” blended, as they print.</p>
          <h3>Aligning the controls in two clicks</h3>
          <p>When the controls do not fall in the right place — a .ppen file made on another map, a slightly rotated scan — ${W("calage")} puts them back: you click a control, then the place where it should be, and do this twice, with two controls far apart. From
            this the tool works out the offset, the rotation and the scale. If the scale changes, it offers to correct either the map (the image's resolution or the PDF's scale),
            which keeps the course lengths right, or the controls. A .ppen made on an OCAD map, imported with the same OCAD map, needs no alignment.</p>
          <h3>Georeferencing</h3>
          <p>For the climb, field mode, GPX files and group analysis, the map's place on the Earth must be known. A georeferenced OCAD or Mapper map
            (Lambert 93, UTM, OCAD's systems) and a georeferenced TIFF are placed automatically. Otherwise, ${W("georef")}: two points of the
            map (a junction, a building corner) clicked with their latitude and longitude — a right-click on Géoportail or an online map gives
            them —, or three or more for a distorted photo; or a world file (.jgw, .pgw… with its .prj); or a KMZ of the same image. The dialog
            checks the scale obtained against the map's.</p>

          <h3>The ribbon</h3>
          <p>The tabs follow the work: <b>Course setting</b> to place the controls and items, <b>Courses</b> to build the courses, their variations and their
            printing, <b>Map</b> for the map itself (changing it, aligning it, georeferencing it, how the purple sits on it), <b>Check</b>, <b>Print</b>
            (the PDFs and every file to export), <b>Team and race</b> (the team, the field, after the race). The <b>File</b> page gathers what is
            seldom needed: the event's information, new, open, import, save and the versions, each file to export with what it is for,
            sharing, offline and the options.</p>
          <p>A greyed-out button says why in its tooltip (“Choose a course first”, “from the day of the race”…): you never come across a command that
            refuses. Each button's tooltip also says what it does, its key, and where it is in Purple Pen mode; F1 opens the guide at its chapter.
            Some settings are made in the ribbon itself, with immediate effect: the print scale, the standard and language of the descriptions, the size of the
            circles, lines and numbers, how the purple sits on the map and a leg's flagging, each shown in miniature.</p>
          <h3>The selected object's tab</h3>
          <p>Selecting a control brings up the <b>Control</b> tab: its code, its description, a fork or loops from it, a line of text before or
            after it, cutting its circle, the map exchange, and what is known about it (its courses, its load, the length to the next one). A leg has the
            <b>Leg</b> tab (bend, gap, route, flagging), a special item the <b>Item</b> tab (appearance, courses, corners), and a line or an area
            being drawn the <b>Drawing</b> tab, with “Finish” and “Cancel”. Selected from the Course setting tab, the object opens its tab
            by itself; from another tab, its tab appears and flashes, without taking the place of the one you are working in. Commands that need a place
            (“Add bend”, “Cut the circle”) then ask for a click on the map; Esc gives up.</p>
          <h3>The quick-access bar</h3>
          <p>Next to the title, whatever the tab, it keeps the most used commands one click away: undo, redo, the PDF of the
            current course (to print a proof, with the latest settings), the event audit and the course properties. Its ▾ adds
            or removes others (save, the PDF of all courses, the print area, IOF XML, the versions, the comments, field
            mode…); a right-click on any ribbon button adds it, a right-click in the bar removes it. It is kept on this browser.</p>
          <h3>Finding a command</h3>
          <p>The <b>search</b>, at the top (Alt + Q), finds a command by a word of its name or of what it does (“fork”, “gpx”, “align”, “scale”), and
            says where it is; Enter runs it and makes its button flash, so that you find it next time. <b>Alt</b> alone shows a letter on each
            tab, then, once the tab is chosen, on each button: two keys run any command without the mouse.</p>
          <h3>More room for the map</h3>
          <p>The ▭ button, top right, puts the ribbon on <b>a single line</b> of small buttons, or keeps only <b>its tabs</b> (Ctrl + F1): it then opens
            over the map when a tab is clicked and closes again after the command. If you make no choice, it is <b>automatic</b>: full, on a single line
            when the window is less than 800 pixels high (a laptop screen), and reduced to its tabs in full window (⤢), where the map takes all the
            room; File › Options sets both cases. When the window is narrow, the groups fold up by themselves, starting from the right, each into a
            button that opens it.</p>
          <h3>Purple Pen mode</h3>
          <p>Those who know Purple Pen can keep its menus: File › Options, or the ▭ button › Purple Pen mode, replaces the ribbon with the File,
            Event, Course, Reports and View menus and the toolbar. View › O'CN mode, or the “Ribbon” button at the top right, brings the ribbon back. The
            two modes do the same things, and the choice is kept on this browser; the chapter “Purple Pen mode” gives, for each command of the menus, its
            place in the ribbon.</p>
          <h3>Moving around the map</h3>
          <p>The wheel zooms around the mouse; dragging where there is nothing (or right-dragging) moves the map; so do the arrow keys. Map › View › Entire
            course and Entire map reframe it. Zooming far into an OCAD, Mapper or PDF map redraws it sharp.</p>
          <h3>Selecting, moving, deleting</h3>
          <p>With the Select tool, a click selects a control, a leg, a number or an item; it is highlighted in blue, its description line in yellow.
            Dragging a selected object moves it. A selected object shows its <b>handles</b>: a leg's bends, the edges of its gaps, an area's
            corners, the corner of the descriptions; they can be dragged. Del deletes the object; in a course, a control is only removed from the course and stays in
            “All controls”.</p>
          <h3>The right-click</h3>
          <p>Right-clicking on the map opens the menu of the object under the mouse, with exactly the commands of its tab, group by group, worded for
            the spot clicked: for a control, its description, a fork or loops, a map exchange, a line of text, cutting its circle here, removing it;
            for a leg, a bend or a gap here, removing this bend, the route, the flagging; for an item, its appearance, a corner here or this
            corner, the courses it appears on. On a ribbon button, right-clicking adds it to the quick-access bar.</p>
          <h3>The keyboard</h3>
          <div class="table-wrap"><table class="data compact tr-doc-tools"><thead><tr><th>Key</th><th>Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody>
            ${KEYS.map(([k, v]) => html`<tr><td style="white-space:nowrap"><b>${k}</b></td><td>${v}</td></tr>`)}</tbody></table></div>

          </tbody></table></div>
          <h3>“All controls” and the courses</h3>
          <p>The <b>All controls</b> tab gathers all the event's controls, with their codes. A control placed there does not yet belong to any course. A
            control placed in a course is in that course as well. The same control can serve several courses: in a course, the other courses' controls are shown faintly
            when the Control tool is active (or always, with ${W("view-all")}); a click on one of them adds it to the course.</p>
          <h3>Where a new control goes</h3>
          <p>In a course, a new control goes:</p>
          <ul class="mx-list">
            <li>just <b>after the selected control</b>, if there is one;</li>
            <li>into the <b>selected leg</b>, if there is one;</li>
            <li>otherwise into the <b>leg nearest</b> to the spot clicked.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To add a control at the end of the course, select the last control, then place the new one. To insert one between 3 and 4, select
            leg 3–4, or simply click near it. The start and the finish always go at the beginning and the end.</p>
          <h3>Codes and numbers</h3>
          <p>Each control gets a <b>code</b> (31, 32…, set by ${W("numbering")}, which by default avoids codes that read upside down); the
            Code field of the Control tab changes it. In a course, the <b>sequence number</b> places itself near the circle, clear of the lines; drag it to
            put it elsewhere, and drop it on its circle for it to place itself again. The course properties can show the code instead, or both.</p>
          <h3>Moving a control</h3>
          <p>Drag it with the Select tool: its legs follow in every course. Moving a control shared with other courses by more than 75 m makes the tool
            ask whether to move it everywhere or create a new one for this course. Shift while dragging drops it exactly on a nearby control.</p>

          <h2>Courses</h2>
          <p>The “+” at the end of the tabs (or ${W("course-new")}) creates a course. Its <b>properties</b> (${W("course-props")}, or a click on
            the header of the descriptions):</p>
          <ul class="mx-list">
            <li><b>Name</b> and <b>classes</b>, printed at the top of the descriptions;</li>
            <li><b>type</b>: normal (the controls in order) or <b>score</b> (the controls in any order, each with its points);</li>
            <li><b>climb</b> and <b>length</b>: the length is calculated (along the bends), the climb comes from ${W("rep-climb")} or is typed in;</li>
            <li><b>print scale</b>: a 1:10,000 map can be printed at 1:7,500 for juniors; circles and numbers then take the size the standard sets (Map › Symbols); it can also be changed in Courses › Printing › Scale;</li>
            <li><b>descriptions</b> in symbols, in text or both, and the controls' <b>label</b>: sequence number, code, or both;</li>
            <li>the <b>expected competitors</b>, for the controls' load.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>${W("course-dup")} copies a course to make another one from it; ${W("course-order")} sorts the tabs. Deleting a course leaves its controls in
            “All controls” (${W("remove-unused")} removes them).</p>
          <h3>Legs</h3>
          <ul class="mx-list">
            <li>A <b>bend</b> (Bend tool) bends a leg to go round an out-of-bounds area; the length follows the line.</li>
            <li>A <b>gap</b> (Gap tool, by dragging) breaks a line or a circle to keep a map detail readable. The tool also cuts
              a line by itself where it crosses another leg of the course (Map › Purple › Appearance sets this gap).</li>
            <li><b>Flagging</b> (the Leg tab, which shows each way in miniature, or the right-click): the whole leg, its beginning or its end flagged, drawn
              dashed.</li>
            <li>A <b>mandatory crossing point</b> (Mandatory crossing point tool) marks a gap or a bridge the runner must go through.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Variations: forks and loops</h3>
          <p>For a relay or a mass-start race, the runners on the same course do not all visit the same controls. Select the control the variations start from,
            then, in its Control tab, Fork here (branches that join up again further on) or Loops here (loops that come back to the same control), with
            the number of branches. A selector appears above the map: choose a branch, and place its controls as usual. The course's length
            is then shown from the shortest variation to the longest. ${W("relay")} shares out the variations among the teams and their
            runners, so that each team runs every branch across all its runners; the PDFs are printed by team and by leg.</p>
          <h3>Several parts</h3>
          <p>A <b>map exchange</b> (Map exchange tool on a control of the course) splits the course into parts: a part selector appears, and each
            part has its print area and is printed on its own sheet. ${W("part-options")} shows the finish on a part or not.</p>
          <h3>The print area</h3>
          <p>${W("print-area")} chooses the paper (A4, A3…), the orientation, the margins, and the part of the map to print; the paper and the orientation can also be changed
            with a click in Courses › Printing › Paper (“fitted to the course” turns the sheet to suit the course). The area places itself, centred on the
            course, or follows a frame drawn on the map. An area larger than the sheet is split over several slightly overlapping pages, or cut down to its
            centre. ${W("view-printarea")} shows it as a dotted line.</p>

          <h2>Descriptions</h2>
          <p>The left-hand pane shows the current course's descriptions, as they will be printed. They follow the IOF standard (2018/2024 by default, or
            2004: Course setting › Descriptions › Standard): one line per control, with its columns C to H — which feature, which one of several, what it is like, its size, where the control is.</p>
          <ul class="mx-list">
            <li>A <b>click on a line</b> selects the control, and the map centres on it.</li>
            <li>A <b>second click on a box</b> opens the symbols of that column; type a few letters to filter (“gul” gives “Erosion gully”). Column F
              also accepts the feature's size (“2 m”, “3 × 4”).</li>
            <li><b>With the keyboard</b>, once the sheet is selected: ↑ ↓ change line, ← → change box, Enter or a letter opens the symbols, Del clears the box.</li>
            <li>A click on the <b>code</b> box changes the code; on the <b>title</b>, changes the event's title; on the <b>header</b> (length, climb),
              opens the course properties.</li>
            <li>The <b>finish</b> line (and those of the mandatory crossing points and the map issue point) gives the flagging to the finish: a click chooses its shape.</li>
            <li>A <b>line of text</b> before or after a control (the Control tab › Descriptions, or right-clicking the control) adds an instruction (“Through the village”).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The descriptions are printed in symbols, in text, or both (the course properties). The text is written in the chosen language (Course setting ›
            Descriptions › Language), among 23 languages; ${W("custom-text")} changes a symbol's text. To put them on the map, use the “Descriptions on the
            map” tool: drag a frame, its width sets the size; the bottom right corner resizes them, a right-click spreads them over several columns.
            ${W("pdf-descriptions")} prints them alone, several per page, to cut out for the description holders.</p>

            will go round. ${W("rep-times")} gives, for each course, the expected winning time, based on the results of the last two
            seasons, and the length that gives a target time (chapter “The calculations”).</p>
          <p>The load comes from the number of competitors on each course: ${W("load")} takes it from FFCO's entries when the race is listed there.</p>

          <p class="mx-kicker">Course setting</p>
          <h2>The calculations, explained</h2>
          <h3>The climb</h3>
          <p>The altitude is read every 10 m along each leg from IGN's terrain model (RGE ALTI, accurate to the metre in France), then
            smoothed over three points: the model has small irregularities which, added up, would inflate the climb. The climb is the sum of the ascents,
            rounded to 5 m. In a straight line, a leg that goes round a hill counts the hill: that is why the Route tool lets you draw the
            planned route, which is then used for the calculation.</p>
          <h3>The winning time</h3>
          <p>From FFCO's results of the last two seasons (about a hundred races of the same format), we record for each course the winner's pace, in
            minutes per kilometre, and their official CN 15 days before. The higher the CN, the faster the pace: the relationship is fitted once
            and for all, and gives the pace of a winner with a given CN. For example, on the same course, a winner with a CN of 6,500 runs about 1.3 times
            as fast as a winner with a CN of 3,000.</p>
          <p>FFCO does not publish the courses' climb; the organisers' files often give it (“Results”). On those courses, the winner's time is compared
            with the time their CN would predict, according to the climb per kilometre: the more the course climbs, the longer the winner takes.
            So as not to rely on a handful of courses, the measurement is pulled towards the kilometre-effort rule (100 m of climb is worth 1 km on the flat, that is
            +10% of time for 10 m more per kilometre), the more so the less precise it is. In long distance, the measurement comes back to this rule; in sprint,
            where you run fast and every climb costs more, the effect is stronger.</p>
          <p>Each estimate gives a range: half the reference races have a winning time within it, because the terrain,
            the vegetation and the technical difficulty, which count for a lot, are not part of the calculation.</p>
          <h3>Mistakes and routes</h3>
          <p>A mistake, as in “Splits”: at least 20% and 10 seconds lost on the leg compared with the runner's pace over
            the whole race. Two routes are the same when the two tracks stay within about fifteen per cent of the leg's
            length (25 m at least) of each other all the way; the side (“on the left”, “straight on”) is read relative to the straight line.</p>
          <h3>The collection plan</h3>
          <p>A control can be collected when the last runner of each course that visits it has passed it: their start time, plus the distance to the control
            at a slow runner's pace (15 min/km in forest, 9 in sprint, in a straight line), plus a margin. The controls are shared out among the collectors by
            sector, and each one takes them in the order in which they can be reached.</p>

            points. The points are <b>doubled at the French championships</b>. A class is attached to the course on which most of its runners

            adds up its runners' points. This calculation is not official: every ranked runner counts, since the site does not know the licence
            type, and a runner's club is that of their last race of the year. The cup was not awarded from 2023 to 2025.</p>

          <p>For each season and each class (M14, W21, M45…), the site takes the CNs of all the runners ranked at the end of the season and looks

            is placed in this spread: their <b>percentile</b> is the share of the runners in their class whose CN is lower or equal. A
            runner at the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile does better than 90% of their class. The “all seasons” curve pools the seasons since 2012: it is
            a snapshot of all the runners, not the follow-up of one generation.</p>

          <h2>Classes side by side</h2>
          <p>The “Classes” page shows, at a month-end, how each class's CNs are spread on one shared axis: a light band from the
            10<sup>th</sup> to the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile, the middle half darker (25<sup>th</sup> to 75<sup>th</sup>), the median and the mean. It
            shows at a glance where classes overlap: in forest, in October 2026, the median CN Top of M55 matched that of M16.</p>
          <p>The dots mark <b>the best of each class</b>, by one rule, the same everywhere: in each class of at least 5 ranked runners,
            its best 2% (rounded down), and at least its first; all of them at an equal CN at the cut. A class of 76 runners therefore
            shows one, a class of 192 shows three, a class of 275 shows five. A rule based on each class's spread (spotting the CNs
            that "leave the box" of a box plot) would have treated classes differently: the more spread out a class, the bigger the lead
            needed to leave it, and whole classes would have had nobody. For each, the page gives their rank in their class, how many
            times their class median they score, and their percentile if they raced in M21 or W21.</p>

            <li><span><b>The model</b>: a runner's time on a leg is inversely proportional to their CN. A runner with a CN twice as high takes
              half the time. The reference time of each leg is set so that the best team of all clubs achieves exactly the
              sum of the format's reference times (for the CNE, the mean of the 5 best teams).</span></li>
            <li><span><b>The formats</b> follow FFCO's 2026 rules: CFC N1 to N4 with their composition criteria and their reserved legs (the
              women's and men's first and last legs alternate depending on whether the year is even or odd), CNE men, women, juniors and mini, class
              relays, sprint relay (2 women, 2 men, in the order W-M-M-W). You can also build your own format.</span></li>
            <li><span><b>The best team is truly the best</b>: the site tries every way of sharing the criteria among the legs, then
              chooses the runners by an exact assignment method (the Hungarian algorithm). Age and sex come from the class: a veteran who
              runs M21 counts as an M21. You can change the first team runner by runner, and add the runners who have no CN
              (foreign runners, relay-only runners) with the CN you credit them with.</span></li>
