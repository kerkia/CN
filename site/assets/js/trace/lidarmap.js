// Generated orienteering maps for « Analyse solo » (a prototype, 2026-11-01; administrators only): a trace without a map
// gets one made from the country's open LiDAR by karttapullautin, with OpenStreetMap's roads, paths, buildings and water over
// it (mapgen/run.py, made on GitHub by lidarmap.yml, kept in R2 as 1 km tiles; functions/api/lidarmap/[[path]].js). The page
// asks for the tiles its trace's area touches — the area only, never the trace —, waits for them, and puts them together
// into one image with its world file and .prj: files the page then takes as if they had been dropped, so that everything
// else (the calibration, the files kept for the visit, « ↗ ») works as for any georeferenced map. The tiles' heights (every
// 2 m) give the 3D view its relief (`lidarGrid`).
//
// The grids (2026-11-06; mapgen/grids.py, keep the two in step): France's IGN tiles, "0391_6819", Lambert 93, named by their
// west and NORTH edges in km; Switzerland's "ch_2583_1219" (LV95, swisstopo's own tiles), New Zealand's "nz_1571_5172"
// (NZTM2000), the United States' "us_13_0475_4427" and Canada's "ca_18_0433_5038" (UTM zone on WGS 84), named by their west and
// SOUTH edges in km. `countryAt` tells which grid a place is in, `tileIdsFor` the tiles round points in a grid. A map put
// together beyond France carries its world file in a transverse Mercator georef.js reads (UTM, NZTM; Switzerland's LV95, an
// oblique Mercator georef.js does not know, as UTM 32 with the small rotation between them, exact to a few centimetres over
// the map), and its name its tiles (`gridOfName`): `lidarGrid` and `creditOf` read the grid from it.
